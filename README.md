# Case2D-lite-with-Csharp

Our project is based on [box2D-lite](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d-lite), a 2D physical engine to simulate collision and joint.

We use C# to code our engine and WPF(*Windows Presentation Foundation*) as our graphical presentation.

Run `Demo` to see a few instances we designed and know how our engine works.
